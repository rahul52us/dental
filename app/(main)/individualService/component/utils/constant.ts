          paragraph: "First we will meet to discuss your situation, assess your needs for treatment, and see whether you have found the right therapist here. If you decide to have psychotherapy and you and your therapist feel that the fit is good, you will be given times for the session, and a regular time that is yours will be worked out soon. If it is impossible to come to therapist’s office, teletherapy may be offered with your informed consent. If you prefer a different approach, we will provide a referral."
