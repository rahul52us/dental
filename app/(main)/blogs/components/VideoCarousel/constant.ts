This is just to make sure everyone is on the same page and your well-being is taken care of. But once we get going, your privacy is important to us.Whatever you talk about stays between you and your therapist, and your guardian is only involved when it’s necessary for your health."

Seeking help doesn’t mean you’re weak—it means you’re strong enough to take care of yourself.
